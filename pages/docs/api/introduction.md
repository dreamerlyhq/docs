# API Reference

The Dreamerly API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Dreamerly API in test mode, which doesn't affect your live data or interact with the blockchain networks.

The Dreamerly API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
