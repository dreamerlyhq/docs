# Dashboard basics

The Dreamerly Dashboard is a user interface that lets you manage and configure your account. Use it to navigate to important resources, deploy NFT collections, monitor your integration, and more.

## Collections

[Collections](https://app.dreamerly.com/collections) includes everything you need to manage your NFT collections. On the Collections page, you can view your list of NFT collections and deploy new NFT collections to the blockchain.
