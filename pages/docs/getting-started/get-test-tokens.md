# Get test tokens

Before creating an NFT collection on Dreamerly, you need to fill your wallet with some tokens to pay for gas fees. In the test environment, you can easily get test tokens on the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

- Navigate to the [Profile page](https://app.dreamerly.com/profile) by click on your profile on the top right corner, then clicking **View Profile**.
- On the [Profile page](https://app.dreamerly.com/profile), find your wallet address. You can click on the wallet address to copy it to the clipboard.
- In a different browser tab, open the [Polygon Faucet site](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
- Under **Network**, select the Mumbai testnet. Under **Select Token**, choose "MATIC Token".
- Paste your wallet address into the **Wallet Address** field, then click the **Submit** button.
- Review the transaction details in the popup, and click **Confirm**.
- Wait for a few minutes for the transaction to be processed, then open a [Polygon blockchain explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) to verify that you have received the test tokens. Make sure that you specify the testnet.
