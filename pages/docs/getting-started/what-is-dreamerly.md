# What is Dreamerly?

Dreamerly is a mobile-native, app store-compliant, and fully customizable suite of toolkits for iOS and Android developers looking to integrate NFT and web3 features into their apps. Our open-source framework provides a backend and a wrapper around Apple's StoreKit to make implementing NFT in-app purchases and transactions easy.

Whether you are building a new app or already serving millions of customers, you can use Dreamerly to:

- Enable in-app NFT purchases that are fully compliant with app store guidelines
- Configure, mint, and transfer NFTs from our dashboard
- Have a single source of truth to sync in-app purchases with blockcchain transactions
- See customer transaction history, NFT-related metrics, and important business indicators
- Get notified of real-time events through webhooks
- Get dedicated support from our team via phone calls, chat, and emails to resolve technical and app review issues
