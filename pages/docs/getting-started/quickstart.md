# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through how to get up and running with NFT transactions and Dreamerly's SDK with only a few lines of code.

### The Dreamerly architecture

Dreamerly has three components:

- Dreamerly Dashboard: Your one-stop shop for all transaction logs, API keys, billing and more.
- Backend HTTP REST APIs: Your backend uses the Dreamerly REST APIs to perform actions such as creating new wallets, deploying NFT collections, minting NFTs, etc.
- Frontend SDKs: Your iOS apps bundle Dreamerly's SDKs to handle in-app purchases and transactions.

### Step 1: Create a Dreamerly account

Sign up for a new Dreamerly account [here](https://app.dreamerly.com).

We recommend using a company account when registering for Dreamerly and setting up your app within a project. You will be able to invite the rest of your team as collaborators on your project.

### Step 2: Create a project

Navigate to the Dreamerly Dashboard and add a new project. **(TODO: NEED TO FIX THE DETAILS AND ADD A SCREENSHOT)**
